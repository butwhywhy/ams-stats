Description: This package provides some functions to analyse directional
    susceptibility measurements to determine the susceptibility matrix
    and provide confidence intervals. Currently, bootstrap method
    proposed in ... and linear perturbation analysis proposed in ...
    are implemented. Methods to produce syntethical data are also
    provide. This package has been used in the paper ... to compare
    the performance of bootstrap and linear perturbation analysis
    methods.
Depends:
