Description: This package provides some functions to analyse directional
    susceptibility measurements to determine the susceptibility matrix and
    provide confidence intervals. Currently, bootstrap method proposed in the
    paper "The bootstrap for magnetic susceptibility tensors" (J Geophys Res
    1990) by C. Constable and L. Tauxe and linear perturbation analysis
    proposed in the paper "The estimation of second-order tensors, with related
    tests and designs"(Biometrika 1963) by G. R. Hext are implemented. Methods
    to produce syntethical data are also provide. This package has been used in
    the paper "On the reliability of the AMS ellipsoid by statistical methods"
    (Tectonophysics 2014) by S. Guerrero-Suarez and F. Martin-Hernandez to
    compare the performance of bootstrap and linear perturbation analysis
    methods.
